    Though the memories of my first school is hazy, yet they are presiously preserved! How I used to cry
    all the day to go home! Innocence! No care for anything else! Where was this competing world then??

<h2><u>My High School</u></h2>
<p>
    I did my schooling at <span class="fsbold" >St. Vincent Convent School</span> at my hometown, <i>Berhampur</i>.<br>

    As it happens with everyone, I have never forgotten my old School. I still walk down the lanes of old memories of
    that enchanted place with elven friends.

<h2><u>My Senior Secondary School</u></h2>
<p>
    After 10th I went to <i>Bhubaneswar</i>, capital of <i>Odisha</i>, for my coaching and 12th board.<br>

    I joined <span class="fsbold" >Buxi Jagabandhu English Medium School</span> for senior secondary studies.
    The memories of this school are still fresh in my mind. It is this school that gave me the required platform to
    jump to a whole new world.
